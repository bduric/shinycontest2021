        <h1 class="display-3">Get Insights!</h1>
        <p>Get your market analysis, sales performance, and customer insights, all in one place. This shiny example is to spark your imagination and get your creative juice flowing. It was developed over 4 years ago and it worked perfectly after an upload in the new workspace proving that the technology is bullet proofed. ouR community is growing  along with package offerings so some further simplifications possible by utilizing tidyverse, vroom, dtplyr but not necessary. I hope you liked it and most of all you find it useful in your work.</p>
